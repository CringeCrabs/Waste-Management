  <p id="text">
    In Myanmar, over <strong>28,850 tons of waste</strong> are generated every single day. Shockingly, more than <strong>40%</strong> of this waste is not properly managed—leading to pollution, clogged waterways, and serious health issues. Children, elders, and wildlife are among the most affected. But with proper waste management, we can create a cleaner, healthier environment.

  <h2 id="skbidi">Health Issues Caused by Poor Waste Management</h2>
  <p id="ohio">
    Poorly managed waste can lead to serious health problems, especially in crowded urban areas. Accumulated garbage attracts pests like rats and mosquitoes, which spread diseases such as dengue, malaria, and leptospirosis. Open burning of trash releases toxic fumes, leading to respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis. Contaminated water sources from uncollected waste can also cause diarrhea and cholera—particularly dangerous for children and the elderly.
  </p>
   <h2 id="skbidi">Benefits of Cleaner Environments</h2>
  <p id="ohio">
    Cleaner environments offer a wide range of benefits for both communities and the planet. With less trash and pollution, there's a lower risk of disease outbreaks and improved public health. Clean surroundings also attract more tourists, boosting local economies. Additionally, a well-managed environment encourages outdoor activities, improves quality of life, and fosters community pride. It also contributes to sustainable development and a healthier future for everyone.
