	<h1> These are our methods on how to get a better sustainable living and less soil pollution.</h1>
	<h2 id="m1">1. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h2>
	<p id="t1">Reduce, reuse, and recycle are the three R's of waste management. By reducing the amount of waste we produce, reusing items whenever possible, and recycling materials, we can significantly reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.
	Reducing waste means using less, reusing means finding new ways to use items instead of throwing them away, and recycling means processing materials to create new products. Sometimes you can even use burnt, destoryed things and create recycled items!.
By doing this you are reducing the amount of waste produced which can be effective into a better living enviorment.</p>
	</p>
	<h2 id="m1">2. Composting</h2>
	<p id="t1">Composting is the process of turning organic waste, such as food scraps and yard waste, into nutrient-rich soil. By composting, we can reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and create a valuable resource for our gardens and plants.
Composting is a natural process that occurs when organic materials break down into a rich soil amendment. It is an easy and effective way to reduce waste and improve soil health. Composting can be done at home or through community programs, and it is a great way to reduce the amount of waste we produce while also benefiting the environment.</p>
	<h2 id="m1">3. Organizing Trash and waste</h2>
	<p id="t1">Organizing trash and waste is an important step in effective waste management. By separating different types of waste, we can ensure that recyclable materials are properly processed and that hazardous materials are disposed of safely.
Organizing trash and waste can be done by using separate bins for different types of waste, such as recyclables, compostables, and non-recyclables. This makes it easier to manage waste and ensures that materials are disposed of properly. It is also important to educate others about the importance of organizing trash and waste, as this can help reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.</p>
	<h2 id="m1">4. Educating Others</h2>
	<p id="t1">You can alert others in your community about the importance of waste management and how they can help. By educating others, we can create a culture of sustainability and encourage others to take action to reduce waste and protect the environment. This can be done by making posters, videos and other informational things.
	<h2 id="m1">5. Eating Less fast food</h2>
	<p id="t1">Eating less fast food allowes you to produce less waste since most fast food are wrapped in paper or boxes and thrown away carelessly. You can also support vegan restaurents, community-managed cafes and much more to support your local enviorment's eco system.
